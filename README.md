# scverse.org

This is a website for [scverse.org](https://scverse.org). This version uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build it.

## Repository structure

### Content

Most of the times, only the content has to be modified. Content is stored as [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) in `.md` files in [`/content`](/content). E.g. to modify the contents of the tutorials page, one has to look inside [`/content/learn/_index.md`](/content/learn/_index.md).

### Styles

For style sheets, [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) is used. Modify [`/assets/main.scss`](/assets/main.scss) to change styles.

### Layout

Modifying layout is only required when pages have to be restuctured or new pages are to be added. Look inside [`/layout`](/layout) for that. [Hugo Templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) is used to work with content from [`/content`](/content).

## Running locally

To build the website (with hot reload), [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and run

```sh
hugo server --buildFuture -D
```
