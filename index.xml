This has motivated us to start something more than a code repository for an exciting new project – a new consortium to organize and support core (mostly) Python tools for single cell life science research. We are excited to announce scverse.</description></item><item><title>Scverse Hackathon 2022-05 Munich</title><link>https://scverse.org/events/2022_05_hackathon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:05 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://scverse.org/events/2022_05_hackathon/</guid><description>Welcome Join us for the scverse Hackathon taking place from Monday, May 2nd, 9:00 AM to Tuesday, May 3rd, afternoon In Munich.
