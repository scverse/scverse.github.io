## Welcome

Join us for the joint [scverse](https://scverse.org) x [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/) hackathon on **March 17-19, 2025** at the Owkin office in Paris.

This hackathon aims to bring together users and developers of scverse tools, researchers, and owkinautes. The main topic of this hackathon will be spatial transcriptomics. During this hackathon, you will have the opportunity to improve existing code bases and add new features to scverse tools. All contributions will be made publicly available on GitHub under an open source license.
