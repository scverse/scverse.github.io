## Hackathon Focus Areas

1. **Interoperability** - Improve compatibility with other languages and tools.
2. **Biological Knowledge Representation** - Enhance the integration of biological information in the scverse ecosystem.
3. **House keeping** - Solve the issues that were forgotten about

### Interoperability Tasks

- Develop AnnData/MuData reader for Julia.
- Develop AnnData/MuData reader for Bioconductor/R.
- Create OME-ZARR reader and writer in R using Rarr.
- Establish a test suite of scverse data files for various implementations.

### Knowledge Representation Tasks

- Develop a backend for BioCypher output and frontend Python package for annotating AnnData.
- Enable access to genomic annotations through Bioconductor AnnotationHub.
- Implement knowledge-guided sparsity for factor models.

### House keeping Tasks

- Integrating scverse tutorials
- Implement scverse example datasets package
- Improve cookiecutter template
- Generate scverse branding content
