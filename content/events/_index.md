## Open community meeting

Scverse community meetings happen **every second Tuesday at 6pm CET** and are open to
everyone! If you are new to scverse, these meetings are a great way to get to know
the people behind the project. 

We usually start off the meetings with a short presentation about a development-related
topic or a new [ecosystem package](https://scverse.org/packages/#ecosystem). 

The meetings have an [open agenda](https://hackmd.io/VfVLKb3ETGKN2j_7tn8ZJQ?edit). If
you would like to bring up a topic, feel free to add it before or during the meeting!

**Agenda**, **next dates**, **meeting notes** and **zoom link** are available from the
[meeting document](https://hackmd.io/VfVLKb3ETGKN2j_7tn8ZJQ?view).
