preface = "For people participaing in and interacting with the consortium, there are different roles. Core developers are deeply involved in developing and maintaining <span class=\"backticked\">scverse</span> projects. Project developers are more focused on individual projects. And all this work makes sense only in the context of the larger community of contributors and users of <span class=\"backticked\">scverse</span> projects. As we strive to make <span class=\"backticked\">scverse</span> governing and communication as transparent as possible, <a href='https://github.com/scverse/governance' target='_blank'>respective documentation</a> is available for everyone to view and comment."
