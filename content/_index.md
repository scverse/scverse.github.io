# Mission

[mission]

text = """\
**scverse** is a consortium of foundational tools (mostly in Python) for omics data in life sciences. It has been founded to ensure the long-term maintenance of these core tools."""

# Ecosystem

[ecosystem]

text = """\
A broader ecosystem of packages builds on the **scverse** core packages. [These tools](/packages/#ecosystem) implement models and analytical approaches to tackle challenges in spatial omics, regulatory genomics, trajectory inference, visualization, and more."""

# Team

[team]

text = """\
**scverse** is a community project currently governed by the developers of the core packages. Please [reach out](/join) if you'd like to be involved!
