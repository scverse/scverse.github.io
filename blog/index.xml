&lt;p>The first scverse conference held in Munich, Germany from 10-12 September, 2024 brought together leading scientists, developers, and researchers from the single-cell genomics and spatial biology community. The conference was organized around five main events: (A) 6 keynotes from leaders in the field (B) 13 short talks from developers, graduate students, postdocs (C) 14 workshops with hands-on experience on various aspects of data analysis and software development (D) Poster session showcasing more than 50 posters (E) Talks from our sponsors showcasing their latest advancements. This year, the focus was on latest community-driven developments in multi-modal and spatial data analysis, broadening scverse accessibility and outreach, and enhancing interoperability. With over 170 participants from 17 different countries, the inaugural scverse conference was a success. Here, we provide major highlights from the conference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello world</title><link>https://scverse.org/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:05 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://scverse.org/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Due to the increasing reliance of scientific research on complex computational pipelines, foundational software in the life sciences has outgrown individual labs and institutes in terms of its scale and impact.
This has motivated us to start something more than a code repository for an exciting new project â€“ a new consortium to organize and support core (mostly) Python tools for single cell life science research.
We are excited to announce &lt;strong>scverse&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
