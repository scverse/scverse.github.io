That has encouraged us to start something more than a code repository for an exciting new project – we are starting a new organisation to maintain and support foundational tools in the life sciences.
Our primary experience lies in the field of computational genomics and lately single-cell sequencing technologies, and this has defined our scope and focus in the very beginning of our journey that we have called scverse.</description></item></channel></rss>
